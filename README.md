## Goal: The implementation of the paper "StructSLAM: Visual SLAM With Building Structure Lines"

## Code reference: 
We borrowed code for vanishing point detection. Great thank you to the author Xiaohu Lu. [Vanishing Point](https://github.com/rayryeng/XiaohuLuVPDetection)

## How to use the code:
1. Download and install the code for vanishing point detection.
`pip install lu-vp-detect`
2. Download the [dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ewqhb32zqpat8rt/AACgVf1YehSYjovLkon6nK-oa/Datasets/Indoor/Bicocca_Static_Lamps/Bicocca_2009-02-25b?dl=0) <br>
Frontal, Groundtruth, IMU_Stretched, Odometry_XYZ.
3. Change the file path for dataset in main.py.
